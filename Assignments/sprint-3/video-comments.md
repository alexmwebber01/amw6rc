In this Chaoss Evolution meeting, the main focus was on new metrics, which were inactive contributors, code length, and forks. Most of the meeting was spent discussing various parts of the inactive contributors metrics. This metric tracks how many contributors have gone inactive over a specific period of time. The group discuess specific wording and formatting issues with the metric, and made a few changes to fix this. They also clarified some issues with the general Chaoss metric outline. They then went through the code length metric, and made some minor tweaks to the wording.
