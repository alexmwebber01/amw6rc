##Thoughts on podcast
As just a student in Computer Science, and not yet involved in the industry much, it is interesting to hear how important open source software is to these people, and also how important these health metrics are. To me, health and sustainability metrics of open source projects does not seem like something that is incredibly important or interesting, so it is cool to hear from people who are very passionate about it. 

I plan to participate in the Value Working Group on April 9th, 10am.
