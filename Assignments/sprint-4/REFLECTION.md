The project that I spent most of my time looking at was the Sails project. I decided to use Sails for the SSO login for a number of reasons.
1. Sails was easy to set up, and the web page it creates is simple, straightforward, and easy to navigate. 
2. I looked at an example web page built with Sails, ration.io, and saw how easy it would be to make a sharp, good-looking page that is easy to navigate.
3. Sails has a lot of features, most of which I'm not familiar with and probably won't use, but having a lot of tools gives me freedom on what I can make my web page do. The full list of features is sailsjs.com/features. 

I managed to set up Sails and create a new Sails project by following their instructions. From there, I created an account and logged in, which brought me to the Welcome screen. 

The only obstacles I encountered in this process was figuring out how to access my Sails project, but I realized it was through localhost on port 1337, so I just had to go to localhost:1337.
